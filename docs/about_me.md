# About Me

Hi! I'm Steven Billington. I'm a software engineer that specializes in DevOps. I have this blog to keep a record of events outside of work and to keep a record of things that I find interesting.

I live out in the Washington DC larger metropolitan area and have been in this area since 2018. I've really started to appreciate the city, especially my neighborhood of Falls Church.

Work wise I'm currently working at [Aurora Solar](https://aurorasolar.com/) as a DevOps Engineer, and have been there since early 2022. Before that I worked at a few defense consulting companies ranging from small 35 person companies to giant megacorps (which you can see on my LinkedIn Profile). I was also in the Army as an Military Intelligence and then Cyber branch Officer from 2013 to 2018.

Feel free to reach out to me via [GitHub](https://github.com/green2jello), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/steven-billington/), or [email](mailto:stkbillington@gmail.com)!
