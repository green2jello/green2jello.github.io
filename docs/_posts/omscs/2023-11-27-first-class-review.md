Hey all!

So this is my first blog post! Yay! Am I late to blogging? Of course. Will anyone ever read this? Likely not! But if you are, then I hope you find something worthwhile here. I wanted to start writing more, and generating more in the world, not just always in a mode of consumption. Writing is especially something I want to work on, as my code is becoming less and less about actual coding language syntax and more and more justifications on why this and why that written for other people instead of compilers. If an AI can write a paragraph about a subject given a prompt, then damnit so can I!

I'm going to start using the classes that I took in my Masters in Computer Science from Georgia Tech (the [OMSCS program][omscs-info]) as sort of an intro and guide into blogging in general. I'll just write a few posts at a time about the classes I took and what I thought of them. Mostly it will be an exercise of reflection on my end and also a way for me to ease into writing.

So what's up first? [Knowledge Based AI][kbai] (KBAI). I took the class back in Spring of 2020, starting right before the pandemic kicked off in earnest in the US. I think the class has had a major revamping between when I took it. I ended up selecting this as my first class because it was going to be a mix of writing and coding. The writing I was confident that I would be able to do, and I felt like it would not be "easy" in terms of effort but it's relatively straightforward. I was right about that as well. I would watch the lecture videos, maybe take notes on the videos, and then write about the concepts that were covered. I have no real recollection of any of the topics of the essays, or what AI topics were covered. In retrospect, it was a great little encapsulation of the program: if you don't have a programming assignment about the topic you will forget it quickly. But that's not to say I didn't gain anything out of it. I learned about LaTeX and how to make writing feel a bit like coding, wrote for an audience for the first time in a while, and was learning about concepts that I had never heard of. In many ways learning about something without immediate practicality to daily life was and is a great way to keep my mind engaged. The essays weren't a cake walk though.  It takes time to outline your thoughts. It takes time to write. It takes time to format and submit these papers.

The coding assignments I do vividly remember though. We were going through [Raven's Progressive Matrices][rpm] (RPM) with the expectation of being able to code up a system to solve a variety of RPM puzzles with code we had written. There were three seperate assignments that felt like they had a natural progression to them. The coding was done in Python. I felt very intimidated by the coding portion at the onset because I a) had some pretty bad imposter syndrome about my coding abilities, and b) felt like my coding abilities would not be up to par for a "Masters" Level course. I was pleasantly wrong about that. The benefit for doing coding assignments is that my grade was not based on how clean, neat, or performant it was. It was graded based on whether or not it solved the assignment! And having an assignment like this was a great way to focus and deep dive. I could just bang away at the assignment and write crappy if statements and multi nested for loops and I didn't have to care. As long as the code ran, and solved the assignment then that was success. I could be creatively problem solving without working about form or style or judgement or others. This quickly became my favorite part of the class. On the flip side, the coding assignments always come at a different cost: time. They take time to do well, especially if you are a relative novice in programming in that particular language.

Overall I felt like I would spend about 5 to 10 hours during the work week on this class and up to 8 hours on weekends on this course. In terms of "difficulty" I would say that overall this was medium. The topics weren't so dense that you had to do a lot of extra learning outside of the lectures to figure out what was going on. I enjoyed the class, but in particular I enjoyed that this was my introduction into the OMSCS program.
