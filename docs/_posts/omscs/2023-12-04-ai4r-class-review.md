Hey all!

Welcome back. Last time I went over a review of [Knowledge Based AI][kbai] class for the [OMSCS program][omscs-info]. This time I'll be going over the second class I took: [AI for Robotics][ai4r].

I took the class in Summer of 2020. The thing to note about summer classes is that they are shorter by a few weeks compared to the full semester. The classes will usually go through a variety of ways of being abbreviated: dropping extra lessons, having a totally different structure for the class, or just shortening the window of time you have to complete assignments. I believe this class used a combination of dropping a few extra lessons and just giving less time to complete assignments. You have to be strategic about which classes you end up taking in the summer, and which you want to take in the fall. If you want to finish the program quickly the advice is to pair a hard class with an easy class in the full semesters, and a medium to hard difficulty class in the summer. But YMMV on all of these.

I ended up picking this class because it was listed as an easy to medium difficulty class. The class also used Python, which I was familiar with from work and from the KBAI class.

The class explored a lot of topics AI topics that assist in robotics. Some of the big ones from memory include particle filters, kalman filters, PID controller, graph based pathfinding (my first introduction to A*), and online SLAM. I don't think the class has changed much since it's inception either. The videos are really just high level overviews of the topics, and working on the projects early is the best way to learn the topics.

This was also the first time that I discovered that the lecture videos and readings wouldn't suffice and that I would have to search out topics in other locations to actually learn the topics. I feel two ways about this: on the one hand, it's reallly frustrating that to succeed in the class you have to veer outside of the syllabus and figure it out yourself. On the other hand, this feels much more realistic of how this goes in work. You quickly learn to crowdsource which resources are the best for learning the topics quickly enough to return back to the projects.

Will I ever use these topics again? Likely not. I don't work in robotics or a robotics related field. The topic was really interesting though, and it was definitely a reintroduction to math that I had forgotten for quite a long time. Knowing where you are in space involves quite a bit of geometry and trigonemetry.

I struggled with this class at first, especially because I just couldn't understand the math from the lecture videos. That realization about learning from other sources was the biggest takeaway I got from this course. Overall I spent about 7 to 10 hours during the work week, and about 8 to 12 hours on the weekends working through the projects. The topics were very interesting but the topics learned are somewhat niche unless you work in robotics.
